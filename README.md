# Conference website

Capstone Project

- The project is an individual assessment to demonstrate the existing knowledge of HTML and CSS and Bootstrap. It entails building a website for a Web development conference that is set to occur very soon.
- I opted to build one that applies to TechHat Company. It has three pages.

1. The Home page
2. The About page
3. The Tickets page

Each of these pages have versions for 2 different screen sizes:

mobile: up to 768px
desktop: from 768px
